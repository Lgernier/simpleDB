# simpleDB

To run code 
download python 3
download jupyter (pip install jupyter)
run jupyter (jupyter notebook)
connect dev.ipynb to python3.exe as kernel 
then you can run and test cell 
or in terminal  python inMemoryDB.py 


 I think the instructions could be more specific, for example i didnt know if i should have made the 
 data structure from scratch or just use a python dict or a cpp map 
 it might be more fun to implemnet using more basic data structures or 
 maybe implement a back up system to code up where you can use rollback plus a #
 and have the database rollback that many changes or states.
